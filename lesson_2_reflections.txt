What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

the staging area is like a buffer between the working directory and the Git repository and allows us to pace the add/commit in logical groupings.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

by adding only the files that I want to commit to the staging area.
